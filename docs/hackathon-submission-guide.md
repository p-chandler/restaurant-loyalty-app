- **Main Contract**: [0xaEc1165eb2AE7E17f2f1C571d66DBc331E1B55D7](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/address/0xaEc1165eb2AE7E17f2f1C571d66DBc331E1B55D7)

### 4. Source Code
The complete source code is available in two formats:
- **Source Code Package**: `restaurant-loyalty-app-source.zip` - Contains all project files including smart contracts, frontend code, and documentation
- **Deployment Package**: `restaurant-loyalty-app-deployment.zip` - Contains the built frontend application ready for deployment

### 5. Demo Access
To test the application:
1. Deploy the frontend application from the deployment package to a web server
2. Connect MetaMask to the Moonbase Alpha testnet with the following configuration:
   - RPC URL: https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network
   - Chain ID: 1287
   - Currency Symbol: DEV
3. Ensure your wallet has test DEV tokens (available from the [Moonbase Alpha Faucet](https://faucet.moonbeam.network/))
4. Connect your wallet to the application
5. Register as a restaurant owner or customer
6. Test the loyalty point awarding and redemption functionality
