# Restaurant Loyalty System Architecture

## Overview
The Restaurant Loyalty Application is a blockchain-based loyalty program system built on the Moonbeam network (Polkadot ecosystem). It allows restaurants to create loyalty programs where customers can earn and redeem points for their purchases and engagement.

## System Components

### Smart Contracts
1. **RestaurantLoyaltyToken (RLT)**
   - ERC20 token implementation for loyalty points
   - Owned by the main RestaurantLoyalty contract
   - Minted when points are awarded to customers
   - Burned when points are redeemed

2. **RestaurantLoyalty**
   - Main contract managing the loyalty program
   - Stores restaurant and customer information
   - Handles point awarding and redemption
   - Manages restaurant registration and updates

3. **RestaurantLoyaltyFactory**
   - Factory pattern contract for easy deployment
   - Creates both token and main contract in one transaction
   - Sets up proper ownership relationships

### Frontend Application
1. **Customer Portal**
   - Registration interface
   - View earned points across restaurants
   - Redeem points for rewards
   - View transaction history

2. **Restaurant Dashboard**
   - Restaurant registration and profile management
   - Customer management
   - Point awarding interface
   - Analytics and reporting

3. **Admin Panel**
   - System management
   - Restaurant approval
   - Global settings configuration

## Data Models

### Restaurant
```
struct Restaurant {
    string name;
    string description;
    address owner;
    bool isActive;
}
```

### Customer
```
struct Customer {
    string name;
    uint256 totalPoints;
    bool isRegistered;
}
```

## Core Functionality

### For Restaurants
1. Register in the loyalty program
2. Update restaurant information
3. Award points to customers
4. Define redemption options
5. View customer activity and analytics

### For Customers
1. Register in the loyalty program
2. Earn points from restaurant visits
3. View point balance across restaurants
4. Redeem points for rewards
5. View transaction history

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer (Moonbeam)
- Smart contracts deployed on Moonbase Alpha testnet
- ERC20 token for loyalty points
- On-chain storage of core data

### Backend Services
- API for frontend interaction with blockchain
- Indexing service for efficient data retrieval
- Notification service for real-time updates

### Frontend Layer
- React-based web application
- Integration with MetaMask for wallet connectivity
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Integration Flow

1. **Customer Registration**
   - Customer creates account via frontend
   - MetaMask transaction to register on-chain
   - Customer data stored in smart contract

2. **Point Awarding**
   - Restaurant identifies customer via QR code or address
   - Restaurant submits point award transaction
   - Smart contract mints tokens to customer
   - Frontend updates to show new balance

3. **Point Redemption**
   - Customer selects reward to redeem
   - MetaMask transaction to approve token spending
   - Smart contract burns tokens
   - Restaurant notified of redemption

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Only restaurant owners can award points for their restaurant
   - Only contract owner can add new restaurants
   - Only customers can redeem their own points

2. **Token Economics**
   - Points are represented as ERC20 tokens
   - No direct purchase of tokens (only earned through loyalty)
   - Tokens are burned upon redemption

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Minimal personal data stored on-chain
   - Customer identification via blockchain address

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Multi-restaurant Support**
   - System designed to handle multiple restaurants
   - Each restaurant has independent point management
   - Customers can use single account across restaurants

2. **Cross-chain Potential**
   - Future expansion to other Polkadot parachains
   - Potential for cross-chain loyalty point transfers

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Development Phase**
   - Local testing with Hardhat
   - Unit and integration tests

2. **Testnet Deployment**
   - Deploy to Moonbase Alpha testnet
   - Testing with real network conditions
   - Verification on block explorer

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Security audit
   - Frontend deployment
   - Documentation and guides
