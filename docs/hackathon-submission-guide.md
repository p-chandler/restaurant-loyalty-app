## Key Components

### 1. Smart Contracts

Our application consists of four main smart contracts:

- **RestaurantLoyaltyToken**: ERC20 token for loyalty points
- **RestaurantWelcomeNFT**: ERC721 token for welcome gifts
- **RestaurantLoyalty**: Core contract managing restaurants, customers, and loyalty operations
- **RestaurantLoyaltyFactory**: Factory pattern contract for easy deployment

All contracts are deployed on the Moonbase Alpha testnet and can be viewed on the block explorer:

- Factory Contract: [0xB34e549E359571E73843c753D29388Ec4e5E8FF5](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/address/0xB34e549E359571E73843c753D29388Ec4e5E8FF5)
- Token Contract: [0x67B152592426AACeaa0692AeB42D048150B8D0c4](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/address/0x67B152592426AACeaa0692AeB42D048150B8D0c4)
- Main Contract: [0x2cA483b9b259F3118a22b0E1ad1a4F5198ea97b7](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/address/0x2cA483b9b259F3118a22b0E1ad1a4F5198ea97b7)
- NFT Contract: [0x27A2e33E1F13863E64BDc5bc04deCA4A9875231c](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/address/0x27A2e33E1F13863E64BDc5bc04deCA4A9875231c)

## Submission Highlights

### Problem Solved

Blockchain Bites addresses several key issues in traditional restaurant loyalty programs:

1. **Fragmented Loyalty Programs**: Unifies loyalty programs across multiple restaurants
2. **Trust and Transparency Issues**: Provides immutable records of all transactions
3. **Customer Engagement**: Enhances engagement with NFT welcome gifts
4. **Program Management Complexity**: Simplifies program creation and management

### How Polkadot Was Used

Our application leverages the Polkadot ecosystem through:

1. **Moonbeam Network**: Deployed on Moonbase Alpha (Moonbeam's testnet), which provides full Ethereum compatibility while being part of the Polkadot ecosystem
2. **Cross-Chain Potential**: Architecture allows for future expansion to other Polkadot parachains through XCM
3. **Scalability and Low Fees**: Benefits from better scalability and lower transaction fees
4. **Security**: Leverages Polkadot's shared security model

### Technical Implementation

The application uses:

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, deployed on Moonbeam's EVM
- **Frontend**: React.js with ethers.js for Web3 integration
- **Testing**: Hardhat and Chai for contract testing
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages and custom deployment

### Unique Features

1. **NFT Welcome Gifts**: New customers receive an NFT that can be redeemed for free merchandise
2. **Multi-Restaurant Support**: Unified customer accounts across all participating restaurants
3. **Transparent Point System**: All point transactions are recorded on the blockchain
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for both restaurant owners and customers

## Final Submission Notes

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology, specifically within the Polkadot ecosystem, can revolutionize customer loyalty programs with transparency, security, and interoperability. The implementation of NFT welcome gifts adds a unique and engaging element that provides immediate value to new customers.

The application is fully functional, with all smart contracts deployed on the Moonbase Alpha testnet and a working frontend that allows users to interact with these contracts. The code is open source and well-documented, making it easy for others to understand and build upon.
